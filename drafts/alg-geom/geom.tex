\section{(Aside) Which rings are coordinate rings?}
As an aside, we might ask: which rings are the coordinate ring of some affine variety?
There are some obvious requirements.
\begin{itemize}
	\ii Such ring must be $\CC$-algebras, of course.
	(A $\CC$-algebra is a ring that contains a copy of $\CC$ in it.)
	\ii Such a ring must be finitely generated, since $\CC[V]$
	is generated by $x_1$, \dots, $x_n$.
\end{itemize}
There is a third more subtle condition.
Define an element $r \in R$ to be \vocab{nilpotent} if $r^N = 0$ for some $r \in R$.
For example, $x$ is nilpotent in $\CC[x]/(x^{2015})$.
Call a ring \vocab{reduced} if it has no nonzero nilpotent elements.

\begin{exercise}
	Let $I$ be an ideal of a ring $R$.
	Show that $I$ is semiprime if and only if $R/I$ is reduced.
\end{exercise}
\begin{remark}
	For a ring $R$, this completes the following table:
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}[h]{l|l}
		Ideal $I$ & Quotient $R/I$ \\ \hline
		Maximal & Field \\
		Prime & Integral Domain \\
		Semiprime & Reduced
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	In particular, $(0)$ is maximal, prime, or semiprime
	if and only if $R/(0) \cong R$ is a field, integral domain, or reduced, respectively.
\end{remark}

Thus, the third requirement is that a coordinate ring must be reduced.
Conveniently, it turns out that these three conditions are sufficient!
\begin{theorem}[Coordinate Rings are Finitely Generated Reduced $\CC$-Algebras]
	Every finitely generated reduced $\CC$-algebra is the coordinate
	ring of some complex affine variety.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $R$ be this map.
	Because it's finitely generated by some $r_1$, $r_2$, \dots, $r_n$,
	there is some surjective map
	\[ \CC[x_1, \dots, x_n] \surjto R \]
	via $x_i \mapsto r_i$.
	Let $I$ be the kernel of this map.
	Since $R$ is reduced, $I$ is radical.
	Then $R \cong \CC[V]$, where $V = \VV(I)$.
\end{proof}
