\chapter{The structure theorem}
The main point of this chapter is to discuss a classification
theorem for finitely generated abelian groups.
This won't take long to do, and if you like you can read
just the first section and then move on.

However, since I'm here, I will go ahead and state the result as a
special case of the much more general theorem \emph{structure theorem}.

\section{Finitely generated abelian groups}
\begin{definition}
	An abelian group $G = (G,+)$ is \vocab{finitely generated}
	if it is finitely generated as a $\ZZ$-module: that is,
	there exists a finite collection $b_1, \dots, b_m \in G$,
	such that every $x \in G$ can be written in the form
	$c_1b_1 + \dots + c_mb_m$ for some $c_1, \dots, c_m \in \ZZ$.
\end{definition}
