\chapter{Some Applications (In Progress)}
With all this setup, we now take the time to develop some nice
results which are of independent interest.

\section{Frobenius Divisibility}
\begin{theorem}
	[Frobenius Divisibility]
	Let $V$ be a complex irrep of a finite group $G$.
	Then $\dim V$ divides $|G|$.
\end{theorem}
The proof of this will require algebraic integers
(developed in the algebraic number theory chapter).
Recall that an \emph{algebraic integer} is a complex number
which is the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients,
and that these algebraic integers form a ring $\ol\ZZ$
under addition and multiplication, and that $\ol\ZZ \cap \QQ = \ZZ$.

First, we prove the following lemma.
\newcommand{\tempuuujbhtkx}{$\ZZ[G]$}
\begin{lemma}[Elements of \tempuuujbhtkx\ are Integral]
	\label{lem:group_ring_integral}
	Let $\alpha \in \ZZ[G]$.
	Then there exists a monic polynomial $P$ with integer coefficients
	such that $P(\alpha) = 0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $A_k$ be the $\ZZ$-span of $1, \alpha^1, \dots, \alpha^k$.
	Since $\ZZ[G]$ is Noetherian,
	the inclusions $A_0 \subseteq A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq \dots$
	cannot all be strict, hence $A_k = A_{k+1}$ for some $k$,
	which means $\alpha^{k+1}$ can be expressed in terms of
	lower powers of $\alpha$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
	[Proof of Frobenius Divisibility]
	Let $C_1$, \dots, $C_m$ denote the conjugacy classes of $G$.
	Then consider the rational number \[ \frac{|G|}{\dim V}; \]
	we will show it is an algebraic integer, which will prove the theorem.
	Observe that we can rewrite it as
	\[
		\frac{|G|}{\dim V}
		= \frac{|G| \left< \chi_V, \chi_V \right>}{\dim V}
		= \sum_{g \in G} \frac{\chi_V(g) \ol{\chi_V(g)}}{\dim V}.
	\]
	We split the sum over conjugacy classes, so
	\[
		\frac{|G|}{\dim V}
		=
		\sum_{i=1}^m \ol{\chi_V(C_i)} \cdot \frac{|C_i| \chi_V(C_i)}{\dim V}.
	\]
	We claim that for every $i$,
	\[ \frac{|C_i| \chi_V(C_i)}{\dim V}
		= \frac{1}{\dim V} \Tr T_i \]
	is an algebraic integer,
	where \[ T_i \defeq \rho\left(\sum_{h \in C_i} h\right). \]
	To see this, note that $T_i$ commutes with elements of $G$,
	and hence is an intertwining operator $T_i : V \to V$.
	Thus by Schur's Lemma, $T_i = \lambda_i \cdot \id_V$
	and $\Tr T = \lambda_i \dim V$.
	By \Cref{lem:group_ring_integral}, $\lambda_i \in \ol\ZZ$, as desired.
	
	Now we are done, since $\ol{\chi_V(C_i)} in \ol\ZZ$ too
	(it is the sum of conjugates of roots of unity),
	so $\frac{|G|}{\dim V}$ is the sum of products of algebraic integers,
	hence itself an algebraic integer.
\end{proof}

\section{Burnside's Theorem}
We now prove a group-theoretic result.
This is the famous poster child for representation theory
(in the same way that RSA is the poster child of number theory)
because the result is purely group theoretic.

Recall that a group is \emph{simple} if it has no normal subgroups.
In fact, we will prove the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Burnside]
	Let $G$ be a nonabelian group of order $p^a q^b$ (where $a,b \ge 0$).
	Then $G$ is not simple.
\end{theorem}
In what follows $p$ and $q$ will always denote prime numbers.

\begin{lemma}[On $\gcd(|C|, \dim V) = 1$]
	Let $V = (V, \rho)$ be an complex irrep of $G$.
	Assume $C$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ with $\gcd(|C|, \dim V) = 1$.
	Then for any $g \in C$, either
	\begin{itemize}
		\ii $\rho(g)$ is multiplication by a scalar, or
		\ii $\chi_V(g) = \Tr \rho(g) = 0$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	If $\eps_i$ are the $n$ eigenvalues of $\rho(g)$ (which are roots of unity),
	then from the proof of Frobenius divisibility we know
	$\frac{|C|}{n} \chi_V(g) \in \ol\ZZ$,
	thus from $\gcd(|C|, n) = 1$ we get 
	\[ \frac1n \chi_V(g) = \frac1n(\eps_1 + \dots + \eps_n) \in \ol\ZZ. \]
	So this follows readily from a fact from algebraic number theory,
	namely \Cref{prob:rep_lemma}:
	either $\eps_1 = \dots = \eps_n$ (first case) or
	$\eps_1 + \dots + \eps_n = 0$ (second case).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	[Simple Groups Don't Have Prime Power Conjuagcy Classes]
	Let $G$ be a finite simple group.
	Then $G$ cannot have a conjugacy class of order $p^k$ (where $k > 0$).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	By contradiction.
	Assume $C$ is such a conjugacy class, and fix any $g \in C$.
	By the second orthogonality formula (\Cref{prob:second_orthog})
	applied $g$ and $1_G$ (which are not conjugate since $g \neq 1_G$) we have
	\[ \sum_{i=1}^r \dim V_i \chi_{V_i}(g) = 0 \]
	where $V_i$ are as usual all irreps of $G$.
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that there exists a nontrivial irrep $V$
		such that $p \nmid \dim V$ and $\chi_V(g) \neq 0$.
		(Proceed by contradiction to show that $-\frac1p \in \ol\ZZ$ if not.)
	\end{exercise}
	Let $V = (V, \rho)$ be the irrep mentioned.
	By the previous lemma, we now know that $\rho(g)$ acts as a scalar in $V$.

	Now consider the subgroup
	\[ H = \left< ab\inv \mid a,b \in C \right> \subset G. \]
	We claim this is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$.
	It is easy to check $H$ is normal,
	and since $|C| > 1$ we have that $H$ is nontrivial.
	Each element of $H$ acts trivially in $G$,
	so since $V$ is nontrivial and irreducible $H \neq G$.
	This contradicts the assumption that $G$ was simple.
\end{proof}

With this lemma, Burnside's Theorem follows by partitioning
the $|G|$ elements of our group into conjugacy classes.
Assume for contradiction $G$ is simple.
Each conjugacy class must have order either $1$ (of which there are $|Z(G)|$)
or divisible by $pq$, but on the other hand the sum equals $|G| = p^aq^b$.
Consequently, we must have $|Z(G)| > 1$.
But $G$ is not abelian, hence $Z(G) \neq G$,
thus the center $Z(G)$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup,
contradicting the assumption that $G$ was simple.
