\chapter{Semisimple algebras}
In what follows, assume the field $k$ is algebraically closed.

A \vocab{completely reducible} representation is one which
can be written as a direct sum of irreducible representations.
We like these types of representations, because they don't have the
undesired behavior of being indecomposable while being reducible.

Now, we name the good algebras:
a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ is \vocab{semisimple}
if all its finite-dimensional representations are completely reducible.
The culminating point of the chapter is when we
prove that $A$ is semisimple if and only if
$A \cong \bigoplus_i \Mat(V_i)$,
where the $V_i$ are the irreps of $A$ (yes, there are only finitely many!).

The goal for the chapter is to examine these in more detail:
we'll find conditions on algebras $A$ which cause all its representations
to be completely reducible.

\section{Schur's lemma continued}
\prototype{For $V$ irreducible,
	$\Homrep(V^{\oplus 2}, V^{\oplus 2}) \cong k^{\oplus 4}$.}
\begin{definition}
	For an algebra $A$ and representations $V$ and $W$,
	we let $\Homrep(V,W)$ be the set of intertwining operators between them.
	(It is also a $k$-algebra.)
\end{definition}

By Schur's lemma, we already know that if $V$ and $W$ are irreps, then
\[
	\Homrep(V,W) \cong
	\begin{cases}
		k & \text{if $V \cong W$} \\
		0 & \text{if $V \not\cong W$}.
	\end{cases}
\]
Can we say anything more?
For example, it also tells us that 
\[ \Homrep(V, V^{\oplus 2}) = k^{\oplus 2}. \]
The possible maps are $v \mapsto (c_1v_1, c_2v_2)$ for some choice of $c_1, c_2 \in k$.

More generally, suppose $V$ is an irrep and consider
\[ \Homrep(V^{\oplus m}, V^{\oplus n}). \]
Intertwining operators are determined completely
$T : V^{\oplus m} \to V^{\oplus n}$ by the $mn$ choices of compositions
\begin{diagram}
	V & \rInj & V^{\oplus m} & \rTo^T & V^{\oplus n} & \rSurj & V
\end{diagram}
where the first arrow is inclusion to the $i$th component of $V^{\oplus m}$
(for $1 \le i \le m$) and the second arrow is inclusion to the $j$th
component of $V^{\oplus n}$ (for $1 \le j \le n$).
However, by Schur's lemma on each of these compositions,
we know they must be constant.

Thus, $\Homrep(V^{\oplus n}, V^{\oplus m})$ consist of $n \times m$ ``matrices''
of constants, and the map is provided by
\[
	\begin{pmatrix}
		c_{11} & c_{12} & \dots & c_{1(n-1)} & c_{1n} \\
		c_{21} & c_{22} & \dots & c_{2(n-1)} & c_{1n} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
		c_{m1} & c_{m2} & \dots & c_{m(n-1)} & c_{mn}
	\end{pmatrix}
	\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix}
	\in V^{\oplus n}
\]
where the $c_{ij} \in k$ but $v_i \in V$; note the type mismatch!
This is \emph{not} just a linear map $V^{\oplus n_i} \to V^{\oplus m_i}$;
rather, the outputs are $m$ \emph{linear combinations} of the inputs.

More generally, we have the following result.
\begin{theorem}
	[Schur's lemma for completely reducible representations]
	\label{thm:compred_schur}
	Let $V$ and $W$ be completely reducible representations,
	and set $V = \bigoplus V_i^{\oplus n_i}$, $W = \bigoplus V_i^{\oplus m_i}$
	for integers $n_i, m_i \ge 0$, where each $V_i$ is an irrep.
	Then
	\[ \Homrep(V, W)
		\cong \bigoplus_i \Mat_{n_i \times m_i}(k) \]
	meaning that an intertwining operator $T : V \to W$
	amounts to, for each $i$, an $n_i \times m_i$ matrix of constants
	which gives a map $V_i^{\oplus n_i} \to V_i^{\oplus m_i}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
	[Subrepresentations of completely reducible representations]
	\label{cor:subrep_schur}
	Let $V = \bigoplus V_i^{\oplus n_i}$ be completely reducible.
	Then any subrepresentation $W$ of $V$ is isomorphic
	to $\bigoplus V_i^{\oplus m_i}$ where $m_i \le n_i$ for each $i$,
	and the inclusion $W \injto V$ is given
	by the direct sum of inclusion $V_i^{\oplus m_i} \injto V_i^{\oplus n_i}$,
	which are $n_i \times m_i$ matrices.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Apply Schur's lemma to the inclusion $W \injto V$.
\end{proof}



\section{Density theorem}
We are going to take advantage of the previous result to prove that
finite-dimensional algebras have finitely many irreps.

\begin{theorem}
	[Jacobson density theorem]
	Let $(V_1, \rho_1)$, \dots, $(V_r, \rho_r)$ be pairwise nonisomorphic
	finite-dimensional representations of $A$.
	Then the map of vector spaces
	\[ \bigoplus_{i=1}^r \rho_i : A \surjto \bigoplus_{i=1}^r \Mat(V_i) \]
	is surjective.
\end{theorem}
The right way to think about this theorem is that
\begin{moral}
	The density theorem is the ``Chinese remainder theorem''
	for irreps of $A$.
\end{moral}
Recall that in number theory, the Chinese remainder theorem tells us
that given lots of ``unrelated'' congruences, we can find a single $N$
which simultaneously satisfies them all.
Similarly, given lots of different nonisomorphic representations of $A$,
this means that we can select a single $a \in A$ which induces any tuple
$(\rho_1(a), \dots, \rho_r(a))$ of actions we want --- a surprising result,
since even the $r=1$ case is not obvious at all!

\begin{diagram}
	&&& \rho_1(a) &= M_1 \in \Mat(V_1) \\
	&& \ruTo(3,2) & \rho_2(a) &= M_2 \in \Mat(V_2) \\
	\boxed{a \in A} && \ruTo(3,1) && \vdots \\
	& \rdTo(3,1) && \rho_r(a) &= M_r \in \Mat(V_r) \\
\end{diagram}

This also gives us the non-obvious corollary
\begin{corollary}
	[Finiteness of number of representations]
	Any finite-dimensional algebra $A$ has at most $\dim A$ irreps.
	\label{cor:finiteness}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	If $V_i$ are such irreps then 
	$A \surjto \bigoplus_i V_i^{\oplus \dim V_i}$,
	hence we have the inequality $\sum (\dim V_i)^2 \le \dim A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of density theorem]
	Let $V = V_1 \oplus \dots \oplus V_r$, so $A$
	acts on $V = (V, \rho)$ by $\rho = \bigoplus_i \rho_i$.
	Thus by \Cref{prob:reg_mat}, we can instead consider $\rho$
	as an \emph{intertwining operator}
	\[ \rho : \Reg(A) \to \bigoplus_{i=1}^r \Mat(V_i)
		\cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^r V_i^{\oplus d_i}. \]
	We will use this instead as it will be easier to work with.

	First, we handle the case $r = 1$.
	Fix a basis $e_1$, \dots, $e_n$ of $V = V_1$.
	Assuming for contradiction that the map is not surjective.
	Then there is a map of representations (by $\rho$ and the isomorphism)
	$\Reg(A) \to V^{\oplus n}$ given by $a \mapsto (a \cdot e_1, \dots, a \cdot e_n)$.
	By hypothesis is not surjective:
	its image is a \emph{proper} subrepresentation of $V^{\oplus n}$.
	Assume its image is isomorphic to $V^{\oplus m}$ for $m < n$,
	so by \Cref{thm:compred_schur} there is a matrix of constants $X$ with
	\begin{diagram}
		\Reg(A) & \rTo & V^{\oplus n} & \lInj^{X \cdot -} & V^{\oplus r} \\
		a & \rMapsto & (a \cdot e_1, \dots, a \cdot e_n) && \\
		1_A & \rMapsto & (e_1, \dots, e_n) & \lMapsto & (v_1, \dots, v_m)
	\end{diagram}
	where the two arrows in the top row have the same image;
	hence the pre-image $(v_1, \dots, v_m)$ of $(e_1, \dots, e_n)$ can be found.
	But since $r < n$ we can find constants $c_1, \dots, c_n$ not all zero
	such that $X$ applied to the column vector $(c_1, \dots, c_n)$ is zero:
	\[
		\sum_{i=1}^n c_ie_i
		=
		\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & \dots & c_n \end{pmatrix}
		\begin{pmatrix} e_1 \\ \vdots \\ e_n \end{pmatrix}
		=
		\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & \dots & c_n \end{pmatrix}
		X
		\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_m \end{pmatrix}
		= 0
	\]
	contradicting the fact that $e_i$ are linearly independent.
	Hence we conclude the theorem for $r=1$.

	As for $r \ge 2$, the image $\rho``(A)$ is necessarily of the form
	$\bigoplus_i V_i^{\oplus r_i}$ (by \Cref{cor:subrep_schur})
	and by the above $r_i = \dim V_i$ for each $i$.
\end{proof}

\section{Semisimple algebras}

\begin{definition}
	A finite-dimensional algebra $A$ is a \vocab{semisimple}
	if every finite-dimensional representation of $A$ is completely reducible.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	[Semisimple algebras]
	Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional algebra.
	Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\ii $A \cong \bigoplus_i \Mat_{d_i}(k)$ for some $d_i$.
		\ii $A$ is semisimple.
		\ii $\Reg(A)$ is completely reducible.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	(i) $\implies$ (ii) follows
	from \Cref{thm:rep_1mat} and \Cref{prop:rep_direct_sum}.
	(ii) $\implies$ (iii) is tautological.

	To see (iii) $\implies$ (i), we use the following clever trick.
	Consider
	\[ \Homrep(\Reg(A), \Reg(A)). \]
	On one hand, by \Cref{prob:regA_intertwine},
	it is isomorphic to $A\op$ ($A$ with opposite multiplication),
	because the only intertwining operators $\Reg(A) \to \Reg(A)$
	are those of the form $- \cdot a$.
	On the other hand, suppose that we have set
	$ \Reg(A) = \bigoplus_i V_i^{\oplus n_i} $.
	By \Cref{thm:compred_schur}, we have
	\[ A\op \cong \Homrep(\Reg(A), \Reg(A))
		= \bigoplus_i \Mat_{n_i \times n_i}(k). \]
	But $\Mat_n(k)\op \cong \Mat_n(k)$ (just by transposing),
	so we recover the desired conclusion.
\end{proof}

In fact, if we combine the above result with
the density theorem (and \Cref{cor:finiteness}), we also have the following.
\begin{theorem}
	[Sum of squares formula]
	For a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ we have
	\[ \sum_{i} \dim(V_i)^2 \le \dim A \]
	where the $V_i$ are the irreps of $A$;
	equality holds exactly when $A$ is semisimple,
	in which case 
	\[ \Reg(A) \cong \bigoplus_i \Mat(V_i)
		\cong \bigoplus_I V_i^{\oplus \dim V_i}. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The inequality was already mentioned in \Cref{cor:finiteness}.
	It is equality if and only if the map $\rho : A \to \bigoplus_i \Mat(V_i)$
	is an isomorphism; this means all $V_i$ are present.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	[Digression]
	For any finite-dimensional $A$, the kernel of the map
	$\rho : A \to \bigoplus_i \Mat(V_i)$ is denoted $\opname{Rad}(A)$
	and is the so-called \vocab{Jacobson radical} of $A$;
	it's the set of all $a \in A$ which act by zero in all irreps of $A$.
	The usual definition of ``semisimple'' given in books is that
	this Jacobson radical is trivial.
\end{remark}

\section{Maschke's theorem}
We now prove that the representation theory of groups is as nice as possible.
\begin{theorem}
	[Maschke's theorem]
	Let $G$ be a finite group, and $k$ an algebraically closed
	field whose characteristic does not divide $|G|$.
	Then $k[G]$ is semisimple.
\end{theorem}
This tells us that when studying representations of groups,
all representations are completely reducible.
\begin{proof}
	Consider any finite-dimensional representation $(V, \rho)$ of $k[G]$.
	Given a proper subrepresentation $W \subseteq V$,
	our goal is to construct a supplementary $G$-invariant subspace $W'$
	which satisfies \[ V = W \oplus W'. \]
	This will show that indecomposable $\iff$ irreducible,
	which is enough to show $k[G]$ is semisimple.

	Let $\pi : V \to W$ be any projection of $V$ onto $W$,
	meaning $\pi(v) = v \iff v \in W$.
	We consider the \emph{averaging} map $P : V \to V$ by
	\[ 
		P(v) = \frac{1}{\left\lvert G \right\rvert}
		\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g\inv) \circ \pi \circ \rho(g).
	\]
	We'll use the following properties of the map:
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that the map $P$ has the following three properties.
		\begin{itemize}
			\ii For any $w \in W$, $P(w) = w$.
			\ii For any $v \in V$, $P(w) \in W$.
			\ii The map $P : V \to V$ is an intertwining operator.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exercise}
	Thus $P$ is idempotent (it is the identity on its image $W$),
	so by \Cref{prob:idempotent} we have $V = \ker P \oplus \img P$,
	but both $\ker P$ and $\img P$ are subrepresentations as desired.
\end{proof}

\section{Example: the representations of $\CC[S_3]$}
We compute all irreps of $\CC[S_3]$.
I'll take for granted right now there are exactly three such representations
(which will be immediate by the first theorem in the next chapter:
we'll in fact see that the number of representations of $G$
is exactly equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$).

Given that, if the three representations of have dimension $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$ ,
then we ought to have
\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = |G| = 6. \]
From this, combined with some deep arithmetic,
we deduce that we should have $d_1 = d_2 = 1$ and $d_3 = 2$
or some permutation.

In fact, we can describe these representations explicitly:
\begin{itemize}
	\ii There is a trivial one-dimensional representation $\Ctriv$
	where the map $S_3 \to \CC^\times$ is the identity.
	Thus in $\Ctriv$ every $\sigma \in S_3$ acts as the identity.

	\ii There is a nontrivial one-dimensional representation
	$\Csign$ where the map $S_3 \to \CC^\times$ is given
	by sending $\sigma$ to the sign of $\sigma$.
	Thus in $\Csign$ every $\sigma \in S_3$ acts as $\pm 1$.
	Of course, $\Ctriv$ and $\Csign$ are not isomorphic
	(as one-dimensional representations are never isomorphic
	unless the constants they act on coincide for all $a$,
	as we saw in \Cref{prob:one_dim}).

	\ii Finally, we have already seen the two-dimensional representation,
	but now we give it a name.
	Define $\refl_0$ to be the representation whose vector space is
	$\{ (x,y,z) \mid x+y+z = 0 \}$,
	and whose action of $S_3$ on it is permutation of coordinates.
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that $\refl_0$ is irreducible, for example by showing directly
		that no subspace is invariant under the action of $S_3$.
	\end{exercise}
	Thus $V$ is also not isomorphic to the previous two representations.
\end{itemize}
This implies that these are all the irreps of $S_3$.
Note that, if we take the representation $V$ of $S_3$ on $k^{\oplus 3}$,
we just get that $V = \refl_0 \oplus \CC_{\text{triv}}$.
