\chapter{Functors and Natural Transformations}
Functors are maps between categories; natural transformations are maps between functors.

\section{Functors}
\prototype{Forgetful functors; fundamental groups; $-^\vee$.}
In mathematics, we'd often like to take an object from one category and get an object from another category.
For example, given a group we might like to obtain a set;
given a set, we might like to consider the vector space whose basis is that set,
and so on.
The nice way to do that is using the notion of a functor:
category theorists are always asking ``what are the maps?'',
and so we can now think about maps between categories.

\begin{definition}
	Let $\AA$ and $\BB$ be categories.
	A \vocab{functor} $F$ takes every object of $A$ to an object of $B$
	and every arrow $A_1 \taking{f} A_2$ to an arrow $F(A_1) \taking{F(f)} F(A_2)$.
	You can picture this as follows.
	\begin{diagram}
		& A_1 & & B_1 & = F(A_1) & \\
		\AA \ni & \dTo^f & \rDotted^F & \dTo_{F(f)} && \in \BB \\
		& A_2 & & B_2 & = F(A_2) &
	\end{diagram}
	(I'll try to use dotted arrows for functors, which cross different categories, for emphasis.)
	It needs to satisfy the following requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\ii Identity arrows get sent to identity arrows:
		for each identity arrow $\id_A$, we have $F(\id_A) = \id_{F(A)}$.
		\ii The functor respects composition:
		if $A_1 \taking f A_2 \taking g A_3$ are arrows in $\AA$,
		then $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	[Free and Forgetful Functors]
	Note that these are both informal terms.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\ii A \vocab{forgetful functor} is a functor that ``forgets'' some structure.
		For example, there is a forgetful functor $U : \catname{Vect}_k \to \catname{Set}$
		by taking $V$ to the set of vectors $U(V)$; certainly a linear map $T : V \to W$
		gives a map $U(T) : U(V) \to U(W)$ of the underlying point-sets.
		In other words we ``forget'' that $V$ has a vector space structure.

		Similarly there are forgetful functors from $\catname{Grp}$, $\catname{Ring}$,
		etc. to $\catname{Set}$.
		There is even a forgetful functor $\catname{Ring} \to \catname{Grp}$: send a ring $R$
		to the abelian group $(R,+)$.

		\ii A \vocab{free functor} is in some sense the opposite.
		A free functor $F : \catname{Set} \to \catname{Vect}_k$ can be taken by considering
		$F(S)$ to be the vector space with basis $S$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	There is also a notion of ``injective'' and ``surjective'' for functors (on arrows) as follows.
	A functor $F : \AA \to \BB$ is \vocab{faithful} (resp.\ \vocab{full}) if for any $A_1, A_2$,
	$F : \Hom_\AA(A_1, A_2) \to \Hom_\BB(FA_1, FA_2)$ is injective (resp.\ surjective).

	We can use this to give an exact definition of concrete category:
	it's a category with an faithful (forgetful) functor $U: \AA \to \catname{Set}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
	[Functors from $\mathcal G$]
	Let $G$ be a group and $\mathcal G = \{\ast\}$ be the associated one-object category.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\ii Consider a functor $F : \mathcal G \to \catname{Set}$, and let $S = F(\ast)$.
		Then the data of $F$ corresponds to putting a \emph{group action} of $G$ on $S$.
		\ii Consider a functor $F : \mathcal G \to \catname{FDVect}_k$, and let $V = F(\ast)$ have dimension $n$.
		Then the data of $F$ corresponds to embedding $G$ as a subgroup of the $n \times n$ matrices
		(i.e.\ the linear maps $V \to V$).
		This is one way groups historically arose; the theory of viewing groups as matrices
		forms the field of representation theory.
		\ii Let $H$ be a group and construct $\mathcal H$ the same way.
		Then functors $\mathcal G \to \mathcal H$ correspond to homomorphisms $G \to H$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
	Check the above group-based functors work as advertised.
\end{exercise}

Now we present one much trickier example.
If you don't get this one at first, skip it and come back later.
\begin{example}
	[Covariant Yoneda Functor]
	For a category $\AA$, define the \vocab{covariant Yoneda functor} $H^A : \AA \to \catname{Set}$
	by defining \[ H^A(A_1) \defeq \Hom_\AA (A, A_1) \in \catname{Set}. \]
	Hence each $A_1$ is sent to the \emph{arrows from $A$ to $A_1$};
	so \textbf{$H^A$ describes how $A$ sees the world}.
	Now we want to specify how $H^A$ behaves on arrows.
	For each arrow $A_1 \taking{f} A_2$, we need
	to specify $\catname{Set}$-map $\Hom_\AA (A, A_1) \to \Hom(A, A_2)$;
	in other words, we need to send an arrow $A \taking{p} A_1$ to an arrow $A \to A_2$.
	There's only one reasonable way to do this: take the composition
	\[ A \taking{p} A_1 \taking{f} A_2. \]
	In other words, $H_A(f)$ is $p \mapsto p \circ f$.
	In still other words, $H_A(f) = - \circ f$;
	the $-$ is a slot for the input to go into.
\end{example}

As another example:
\begin{ques}
	If $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ are posets interpreted as categories,
	what does a functor from $\mathbb P$ to $\mathbb Q$ represent?
\end{ques}
\begin{ques}
	Verify that there is a category of \emph{all categories},
	$\catname{Cat}$, whose arrows are functors.
	In particular, you will need to name the ``identity functors''
	and verify that the composition of a functor is also a functor.
\end{ques}

The dual notion of a functor is a \vocab{contravariant functor}.
They work exactly the same way, except the arrows get flipped by the functor.
You can think of this as a functor $\AA \to \BB^{\text{op}}$ (equivalently, $\AA^{\text{op}} \to \BB$). Pictorially:
\begin{diagram}
	& A_1 & & B_1 & = F(A_1) & \\
	\AA \ni & \dTo^f & \rDotted^F & \uTo_{F(f)} && \in \BB \\
	& A_2 & & B_2 & = F(A_2) &
\end{diagram}
For emphasis, a usual functor is often called a \vocab{covariant functor}.

Contravariant functors come up in a lot in geometric applications.
Here's why.
If $X$ is a geometric object, we'll often consider
the \emph{set of functions} $X \taking\psi A$ for some particular $A$.
For example, if $V$ was a vector space, we could consider the functions $V \to k$,
giving the dual module $V^\vee$.
Or if $X$ was a space, we might consider the continuous
real functions $X \taking{p} \RR$.
As a non-geometric example: for a set $S$,
a function $S \to \{x,y\}$ corresponds to a subset of $S$.

Now suppose you have two spaces $X$, $Y$ and a map $f : X \to Y$.
Then given $Y \taking p \RR$, you automatically get a map $X \taking{f} Y \taking{p} \RR$.
And it turns out this is a functor!
This general construction can be done in any category $\AA$, as follows:
\begin{example}[Contravariant Yoneda Functor]
	The \vocab{contravariant Yoneda functor} $H_A : \AA^{\text{op}} \to \catname{Set}$;
	is used to describe how objects of $\AA$ see $A$.
	For each $X \in \AA$ it puts \[ H_A(X) \defeq \Hom_{\AA}(X, A) \in \catname{Set}. \]
	For $X \taking{f} Y$, $H_A(f)$ sends each arrow $Y \taking{p} A \in \Hom_\AA(Y,A)$ to 
	\[ X \taking{f} Y \taking{p} A \quad \in \Hom_\AA(X,A) \]
	as we did above.
	Thus $H_A(f)$ is an arrow from $\Hom_\AA(Y,A) \to \Hom_\AA(X,A)$.
	(Note the flipping!)
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	Dually, there is also a \vocab{covariant Yoneda functor} $H^A : \AA \to \catname{Set}$
	by $H^A(X) = H^A(A, X)$. This guy describes how $A$ sees the world.
	\label{def:covariant_yoneda}
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[$V \mapsto V^\vee$ is Contravariant]
	Consider the category $\catname{Vect}_k$.
	If you read the digression on dual spaces,
	you now know there is a contravariant functor $\catname{Vect}_k \to \catname{Vect}_k$ by
	taking the \emph{dual} $V^\vee$ of a vector space $V$:
	\begin{diagram}
		V & & V^\vee \\
		\dTo^T & \rDotted^{-^\vee} & \uTo_{T^\vee} \\
		W & & W^\vee
	\end{diagram}
\end{example}

Suppose $G \cong H$ are groups, and $U : \catname{Grp} \to \catname{Set}$ is forgetful.
Then we get two sets $U(G)$ and $U(H)$.
These two sets have the same cardinality and are isomorphic in $\catname{Set}$.
Now the beauty of category theory shows itself: this in fact works \emph{for any functors and categories},
and the proof is done solely through arrows.

\begin{theorem}
	[Functors Preserve Isomorphism]
	\label{thm:functor_isom}
	If $A_1 \cong A_2$ are isomorphic objects in $\AA$
	and $F : \AA \to \BB$ is a functor
	then $F(A_1) \cong F(A_2)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Try it yourself! The picture is:
	\begin{diagram}
		& A_1 & & B_1 & = F(A_1) & \\
		\AA \ni & \dTo^f \uTo_g & \rDotted^F & \dTo^{F(f)} \uTo_{F(g)} && \in \BB \\
		& A_2 & & B_2 & = F(A_2) &
	\end{diagram}
	You'll need to use both key properties of functors: they preserve composition
	and the identity map.
\end{proof}

This will be super convenient in algebraic topology, for example.
We'll show from a space $X$ you can create a group $\pi_n(X)$ or $H_n(X)$ that
gives information about the space $X$.
If we can show this is in fact a functor $\catname{Top} \to \catname{Grp}$,
then for $X \cong Y$, we get for free that $\pi_n(X) \cong \pi_n(Y)$ and $H_n(X) \cong H_n(Y)$.

\section{Natural Transformations}
\emph{Note}: we won't use natural transformations anywhere else in the Napkin,
and it's included here just for completeness.

We made categories to keep track of objects and maps, then went a little crazy and asked
``what are the maps between categories?'' to get functors.
Now we'll ask ``what are the maps between functors?'' to get natural transformations.

It might sound terrifying that we're drawing arrows between functors, but this is actually an old idea.
Recall that given two paths $\alpha, \beta : [0,1] \to X$,
we built a path-homotopy by ``continuously deforming'' the path $\alpha$ to $\beta$;
this could be viewed as a function $[0,1] \times [0,1] \to X$.
The definition of a natural transformation is similar: we want to pull $F$ to $G$
along a series of arrows in the target space $\BB$.

\begin{definition}
	Let $F, G : \AA \to \BB$ be two functors.
	A \vocab{natural transformation} $\alpha$ from $F$ to $G$, denoted
	\[ \nattfm{\AA}{F}{\alpha}{G}{\BB} \]
	consists of, for each $A \in \AA$ an arrow $\alpha_A \in \Hom_\BB(F(A), G(A))$, which is
	called the \vocab{component} of $\alpha$ at $A$.
	Pictorially, it looks like this:
	\begin{diagram}
		& & & F(A) \in \BB \\
		\AA \ni & A & \ruDotted(2,1)^F & \dTo_{\alpha_A} \\
		& & \rdDotted(2,1)^G & G(A) \in \BB
	\end{diagram}
	These $\alpha_A$ are subject to the ``naturality'' requirement that for any $A_1 \taking{f} A_2$,
	the diagram
	\begin{diagram}
		F(A_1) & \rTo^{F(f)} & F(A_2) \\
		\dTo_{\alpha_{A_1}} & & \dTo_{\alpha_{A_2}} \\
		G(A_1) & \rTo_{G(f)} & G(A_2)
	\end{diagram}
	commutes.
\end{definition}
The arrow $\alpha_A$ represents the path that $F(A)$ takes to get to $G(A)$
(just as in a path-homotopy from $\alpha$ to $\beta$
each \emph{point} $\alpha(t)$ gets deformed to the \emph{point} $\beta(t)$ continuously).
A picture might help: consider
\begin{center}
	\begin{asy}
		size(14cm);
		dotfactor *= 1.4;

			// Short for "spaced arrow"
			return (0.9*X+0.1*Y)--(0.1*X+0.9*Y);

		p = grey + dashed;

		pair B1 = D(midpoint(FF*A2--GG*A1));

		draw(sparrow(FF*A2, GG*A3), p, EndArrow);
		pair B4 = D(FF*A1 + 0.5*dir(90));
		draw(sparrow(FF*A1, B4), p, EndArrow);
	\end{asy}
\end{center}
Here $\AA$ is the small black category with three elements and two non-identity arrows $f$, $g$
(I've omitted the identity arrows for simplicity).
The images of $\AA$ under $F$ and $G$ are the blue and green ``subcategories'' of $\BB$.
Note that $\BB$ could potentially have many more objects and arrows in it (grey).
The natural transformation $\alpha$ (red) selects an arrow of $\BB$ from each $F(A)$
to the corresponding $G(A)$, dragging the entire image of $F$ to the image of $G$.
Finally, we require that any diagram formed by the blue, red, and green arrows is commutative (naturality),
so the natural transformation is really ``natural''.

There is a second equivalent definition that looks much more like the homotopy.
\begin{definition}
	Let $\mathbf 2$ denote the category generated by a poset with two elements $0 \le 1$, that is,
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
		\SetVertexMath
		\Vertices{circle}{1,0}
		\Edge[style={->}, label={$0 \le 1$}](0)(1)
		\Loop[dist=12, dir=NO, label={$\id_0$}, labelstyle={above=1pt}](0)
		\Loop[dist=12, dir=NO, label={$\id_1$}, labelstyle={above=1pt}](1)
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	Then a \emph{natural transformation} 
	$ \nattfm{\AA}{F}{\alpha}{G}{\BB} $
	is just a functor $\alpha : \AA \times \mathbf 2 \to \BB$ satisfying
	\[ \alpha(0,A) = F(A), \;\; \alpha(0,f) = F(f) 
		\quad\text{and}\quad
	\alpha(1,A) = G(A), \;\; \alpha(1,f) = G(f). \]
	More succinctly, $\alpha(0,-) = F$, $\alpha(1,-) = G$.
\end{definition}
The proof that these are equivalent is left as a practice problem.

Naturally, two natural transformations $\alpha : F \to G$ and $\beta : G \to H$ can get composed.
\begin{diagram}
	& & F(A) \\
	& \ruDotted^F & \dTo_{\alpha_A} \\
	\AA \ni A & \rDotted^G & G(A) \\
	& \rdDotted_H & \dTo_{\beta_A} \\
	&& H(A)
\end{diagram}

Now suppose $\alpha$ is a natural transformation such that $\alpha_A$ is an isomorphism for each $A$.
In this way, we can construct an inverse arrow $\beta_A$ to it.
\begin{diagram}
	& & F(A) \in \BB \\
	\AA \ni A & \ruDotted(2,1)^F & \dTo^{\alpha_A} \uTo_{\beta_A} \\
	& \rdDotted(2,1)^G & G(A) \in \BB
\end{diagram}
In this case, we say $\alpha$ is a \vocab{natural isomorphism}.
We can then say that $F(A) \cong G(A)$ \vocab{naturally} in $A$.
(And $\beta$ is an isomorphism too!)

This is what it really means when we say that ``there is a natural / canonical isomorphism''.
For example, I claimed earlier that there was a canonical isomorphism $(V^\vee)^\vee \cong V$,
and mumbled something about ``not having to pick a basis'' and ``God-given''.
Category theory, amazingly, lets us formalize this:
it just says that $(V^\vee)^\vee \cong \id(V)$ naturally in $V \in \catname{FDVect}_k$.
Really, we have a natural transformation
\[ \nattfm{\catname{FDVect}_k}{\id}{\eps}{(-^\vee)^\vee}{\catname{FDVect}_k}. \]
where the component $\eps_V$ is given by $v \mapsto \opname{ev}_v$
(as discussed earlier,
the fact that it is an isomorphism follows from the fact that $V$ and $(V^\vee)^\vee$
have equal dimensions and $\eps_V$ is injective).

% A last remark: similar to the situation with groups isomorphisms,
% collecting all these $\beta_A$'s gives a natural isomorphism too.
\begin{ques}
	In fact, there is a category $[\AA, \BB]$ of \emph{functors} from $\AA$ into $\BB$,
	whose arrows are natural transformations.
	When are two functors isomorphic in $[\AA, \BB]$?
\end{ques}
As a result of this, we also write $F \cong G$ to mean $F(X) \cong G(X)$

\section\problemhead
\begin{dproblem}
	Let $X$ and $Y$ be objects in a category $\AA$.
	Show that $X \cong Y$ if and only if $H_X(A) \cong H_Y(A)$ naturally in $A$.\footnote{
		From \cite{ref:msci}: let's consider $\AA = \catname{Grp}$ for concreteness.
		Suppose $A$, $X$, $Y$ are groups such that $H_X(A) \cong H_Y(A)$ for all $A$.
		If $A = \ZZ$, then $\left\lvert X \right\rvert = \left\lvert Y \right\rvert$.
		If $A = \ZZ / p\ZZ$, then $X$ and $Y$ have the same number of elements of order $p$.
		Each $A$ gives us some information on how $X$ and $Y$ are similar,
		but the whole natural isomorphism is strong enough to imply $X \cong Y$.}
\end{dproblem}

\begin{problem}
	Show that the two definitions of natural transformation
	(one in terms of $\AA \times \mathbf 2 \to \BB$
	and one in terms of arrows $F(A) \taking{\alpha_A} G(A)$) 
	are equivalent.
	\begin{hint}
		The category $\AA \times \mathbf 2$ has ``redundant arrows''.
	\end{hint}
	\begin{sol}
		The main observation is that in $\AA \times \mathbf 2$,
		you have the arrows in $\AA$ (of the form $(f, \id_{\mathbf 2})$),
		and then the arrows crossing the two copies of $\AA$ (of the form $(\id_A, 0 \le 1)$).
		But there are some more arrows $(f, 0 \le 1)$: nonetheless, they can be thought of as compositions
		\[ (f, 0 \le 1) = (f, \id_{\mathbf 2}) \circ (\id_A, 0 \le 1) = (\id_A, 0 \le 1) \circ (f, \id_{\mathbf 2}). \]
		Now we want to specify a functor $\alpha : \AA \times \mathbf 2$, we only have to specify
		where each of these two more basic things goes.
		The conditions on $\alpha$ already tells us that $(f, \id_{\mathbf 2})$ should be mapped to $F(f)$ or $G(f)$
		(depending on whether the arrow above is in $\AA \times \{0\}$ or $\AA \times \{1\}$),
		and specifying the arrow $(\id_A, 0 \le 1)$ amounts to specifying the $A$th component.
		Where does naturality come in?

		The above discussion transfers to products of categories in general:
		you really only have to think about $(f, \id)$ and $(\id, g)$ arrows
		to get the general arrow $(f,g) = (f, \id) \circ (\id, g) = (\id, g) \circ (f, \id)$.
	\end{sol}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	Let $\AA$ be the category of finite sets whose arrows are bijections between sets.
	For $A \in \AA$,
		let $F(A)$ be the set of \emph{permutations} of $A$ and
		let $G(A)$ be the set of \emph{orderings} on $A$.\footnote{
			A permutation is a bijection $A \to A$,
			and an ordering is a bijection $\{1, \dots, n\} \to A$,
			where $n$ is the size of $A$.}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\ii Extend $F$ and $G$ to functors $\AA \to \catname{Set}$.
		\ii Show that $F(A) \cong G(A)$ for every $A$, but this isomorphism is \emph{not} natural.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	[Yoneda Lemma]
	Let $\AA$ be a category, pick $A \in \AA$, and let $H_A$ be the contravariant Yoneda functor.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\ii \gim
	Let $X : \AA^{\text{op}} \to \catname{Set}$ be a contravariant functor.
	Exhibit a bijection
	\[ X(A) \cong \left\{ \text{Natural transformations }
		\nattfm{\AA^{\text{op}}}{H_A}{\alpha}{X}{\catname{Set}}
	\right\}. \]
	\ii \kurumi Moreover, interpreting both sides as functors
	$[\AA^{\text{op}}, \catname{Set}] \times \AA^{\text{op}} \to \catname{Set}$
	show that the isomorphism is \emph{natural} in $X$ and $A$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
The Yoneda Lemma has tons of very cool consequences; one is that solving it
makes you feel like a minor god.
The proof is long, but it is not actually very difficult -- from start to finish,
there is only one thing you can possibly do.
